REvamp
First app has managed to prove viability.
This is to hard press the foundation as well as getting some practice in.
Cheats like learn by doing repositories on github and youtube have provem ineffective.
I would thouroughly not recommend them unless you going to uni and don't really need to know how to code.
Though even grads need to know how to code, cause it' competitive out there and not everyone likes interns.
